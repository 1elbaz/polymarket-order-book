Step-by-Step Development Plan for Polymarket Order Book Viewer

Based on your current codebase and the comprehensive requirements, here's a structured development plan that builds functionality incrementally with testing at each step.

Current State Assessment
Your codebase shows:

✅ Basic Next.js setup with TypeScript
✅ Jest testing configuration
✅ MSW for API mocking
✅ Basic OrderBook types and API client
✅ Simple OrderBookContext implementation
✅ Basic unit tests for API client and context

Recommended Directory Structure Updates:
Your current structure is good but needs expansion to match the comprehensive plan. I recommend reorganizing to:

src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/           # Shared UI components
│   ├── orderbook/        # Order book specific components
│   ├── market/           # Market selection components
│   └── trades/           # Trade history components
├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
├── lib/
│   ├── api/              # API layer (expand your current apiClient)
│   ├── orderbook/        # Order book calculations and utilities
│   └── formatting/       # Number/date formatting
├── types/
│   ├── index.ts          # Re-exports
│   ├── api.ts            # API response types
│   └── state.ts          # Application state types
└── contexts/             # Keep your current context structure

Development Approach Recommendations
1. Test-Driven Development

Write tests before implementing each feature
Use your existing MSW setup for API testing
Focus on business logic testing first, then UI testing

2. Incremental Building

Each step should result in a working, testable feature
Commit frequently with working functionality
Use feature flags for incomplete features

3. Code Quality Gates

Maintain >80% test coverage for business logic
Use TypeScript strict mode throughout
Implement ESLint rules for consistency

4. Validation Strategy

Test with mock data first
Validate calculations with known test cases
Use real API data for final validation

5. Performance Monitoring

Add performance measurements at each step
Monitor bundle size growth
Test with various dataset sizes
